Infosys's future moves:
    - In July, after resuming his role as executive chairman, N.R. Narayana Murthy said the following about Infosys’ future: “The strategy is to focus on opportunities from consulting-led end-to-end solutions, leveraging technology for higher margins, developing intellectual property-based solutions to delink revenues from effort.” Murthy set three broad goals — improving sales efficiency, increasing automation and boosting employee productivity, and rationalizing cost — but early indications show Infosys making the third goal its priority as the company has been moving to a substantial onshore/offshore ratio shift.
