Deloitte's year founded: 1900.0

Deloitte's reason for establishment:
    - Our story begins with our purpose: making an impact that matters. Something that our founder, William Welch Deloitte, understood well. In 1845, he had a vision to build something that would lastâ€”to bring change to the accounting industry and beyond.
    
    - Understanding the power of connection, collaboration, and innovation, he established Deloitte as a small accountancy firm. And because of his legacy, Deloitte has grown to a thriving global organization of more than 415,1000 people who are dedicated to changing the world.
