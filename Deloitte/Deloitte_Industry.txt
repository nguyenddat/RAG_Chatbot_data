Deloitte's future moves:
    - As increasing connectivity, robotics, and cognitive tools change the nature of work, new talent models and the gig economy are reinventing jobs. Now is the time to reimagine why, where, and how work gets done—and unleash the energy and endless possibilities of human potential.
    - Work re-Architected: Opportunity, resilience, and growth in the accelerated future of work
        - As we reconnect, recover, and shift to thrive, it’s time to rethink the importance of work in the future of work. Work is the most underutilized source of value. It isn’t just a series of steps or outputs. Nor is it just something people do. Work is the key to connection. The key to creativity. The key to innovation. And, if done right, work is the key to productivity and bottom-line results.
