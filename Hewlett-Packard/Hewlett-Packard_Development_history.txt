Hewlett-Packard's year founded: 1939.0

Hewlett-Packard's reason for establishment:
    - When the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) was founded in 1939, the world was a very different place. There were no fully electronic computers. The only printers were industrial-sized printing presses. Palo Alto, California was composed mostly of fruit orchards. The internet was decades away from fruition.
    - The storied history of HP coincides with the development of home computing and the rise of Silicon Valley. HP’s innovations were instrumental in making home computers and printers more affordable for the average consumer, and their success inspired a wave of electronics companies to start-up in Santa Clara County, California. Everyone wanted to hang out in HP’s neck of the woods.
