Google's industry: internet

Google's reason for industry:
    - Towards the end of the 1990s, two doctoral students at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, developed a search engine called “Backrub.” Their goal was to improve the accuracy of search results on the Internet, thus revolutionizing online navigation.

Google's potential customer:
    - Google ads audience targeting, as known as 'audience lists' or 'audience segments', is a group of users that are categorised based on shared characteristics, such as their interests, activities, engagement with your brand as well as search behaviours.

Google's success projects:
    - Google Search
        - Description: Google Search is the flagship product of Google, revolutionizing how people find information online. It is the most widely used search engine in the world.
