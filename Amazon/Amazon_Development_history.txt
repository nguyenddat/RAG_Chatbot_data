Amazon's year founded: 1994.0

Amazon's reason for establishment:
    - After reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2.300%, Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, because of the large worldwide demand for literature, the low unit price for books, and the huge number of titles available in print. Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington.
    - But gradually expanded its services to include a wide range of products. This variety led to it being called "The Store of Everything".
