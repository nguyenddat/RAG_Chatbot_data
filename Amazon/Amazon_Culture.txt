Amazon's community significance:
    - STEM Education:
        + Amazon’s comprehensive childhood-to-career program increases access to computer science education for children and young adults from underserved and underrepresented communities. We also support teachers wanting to bring coding classes to rural areas.
    
    - Right Now Needs:
        + Through in-kind and cash donations, Amazon supports local communities with what we call ‘Right Now Needs,’ including food, shelter, and basic goods for children and their families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we delivered more than 7 million meals to underserved and vulnerable populations.
    
    - Disaster Response and Relief:
        + Our Disaster Relief by Amazon team uses Amazon’s vast operational excellence and worldwide logistics network to fly planeloads and ship truckloads of Amazon-donated items to communities ravaged by natural disasters, such as hurricanes.
    
    - Housing Equity:
        + Our focus on housing equity includes a more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create affordable housing for moderate- to low-income individuals and families in communities we are proud to call home. A $100 million commitment to our nonprofit partner also supports families on their journeys out of homelessness.
