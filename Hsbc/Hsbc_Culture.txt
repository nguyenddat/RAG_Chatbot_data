Hsbc's key values:
    - We value difference
        - We were born speaking different languages. We were founded on the strength of different experiences, attributes and voices; they are integral to who we are and how we work.
        - The greater our empathy and diversity, the better we reflect the worlds of our customers and communities – and the better we can serve them.
        - So we champion inclusivity. We listen. We remove barriers. And we seek out views different from our own.
    - We succeed together
        - We offer our customers a unique breadth of opportunity.
        - And we can only deliver the full promise of this by being truly connected – across boundaries. With our customers and partners. Together as colleagues and as an organisation.
        - So, we collaborate across boundaries. We break down silos. We trust and support each other. And, when necessary, get out of each other’s way.
        - Together, we make possible what we cannot do alone.
    - We take responsibility
        - What we do has a real impact on people’s lives, communities and the planet. We take this responsibility seriously.
        - We set ourselves high standards and are each accountable for our actions. We always use good judgement. And if something doesn’t feel right, as colleagues we speak up and act.
        - We build for tomorrow, today. We succeed only by taking the long view, by focusing on the sustainable interests of our customers, investors, and the planet we all share.
    - We get it done
        - We create value for our customers and investors by always moving forward and making things happen.
        - We’re entrepreneurial: we try new things, we learn and improve, and we take smart risks.
        - We’re dynamic: we reject mediocrity. We move at pace.
        - We’re decisive: we make clear choices and take bold actions.
        - And we keep our word: we always do what we promise.

Hsbc's community significance:
    - Today our focus is on minimizing our impact on the environment and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon global economy. We have an ambitious plan to prioritize financing and investment that helps to build a thriving, resilience net-zero future for society and businesses. Our global climate strategy has three elements:
        - Support our portfolio of customers to make the transition
        - Unlock climate solutions and innovation
        - Transform HSBC into a net zero bank
    - In the US, we primarily focus our philanthropic giving on Future Skills (Employability and Financial Literacy) programs for marginalized communities, as well as on programs that address climate change.
