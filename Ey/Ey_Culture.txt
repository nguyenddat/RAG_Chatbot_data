Ey's key values:
    - Diversity, equity and inclusiveness
    - Corporate responsibilities

Ey's community significance:
    - The Community Impact team helps businesses, not-for-profits and public sector organisations deliver measurable social impact. We design strategies, create portfolios, and build, implement and evaluate high-impact social impact programs across diverse areas.
    - Companies across Australia and New Zealand invest over a billion dollars each year into communities through activities such as philanthropy, sponsorships, matched giving, pro bono and community partnerships. But few are able to describe in detail either the social impact they created, or the business value that was created as a result of the activities.
    - We exist to help organisations build community impact programs, platforms and portfolios that create meaningful, measurable impact, and return value back to the business.
    - Our team has been responsible for the design, implementation and evaluation of multi-award-winning community programs for private sector firms, government departments and not-for-profits, and our capability extends far beyond strategy and advice to include actual boots-on-the-ground implementation of social impact programs that work.
    - EY teams can help your organisation:
        - Develop a compelling, detailed and purpose-aligned articulation of the impact that you are uniquely positioned to have
        - Build a community impact program or portfolio which aligns to your strategic aspiration, is differentiated in the market, and will generate meaningful change
        - Co-create social impact programs with the most important stakeholders in the community through innovative, evidence-based behavioural design consultancy
        - Work with you as an implementation partner to make sure the idea for your programs matches the reality, providing quality-assured, high-impact community programs
        - Measure, evaluate and report on the impact that youâ€™ve had in the community
