Mcdonald'S Corporation's year founded: 1955.0
Mcdonald'S Corporation's reason for establishment:
    - The first McDonald's drive-in was opened in 1940 by brothers Maurice (“Mac”) and Richard McDonald in San Bernardino, California. In 1948 the brothers revamped the business, and a newly envisioned McDonald's restaurant was created to produce huge quantities of food at low prices.
